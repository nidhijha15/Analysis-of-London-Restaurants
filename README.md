2.Data acquisition and cleaning
2.1 Data sources
The main sources of this project were:
 Wikipedia: To obtain the list of neighborhoods and boroughs in London
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_areas_of_London)
 Citypopulation: To obtain the population of the boroughs
(https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/greaterlondon/)
 FourSquare: To obtain the location, venues of the different restaurants in a
borough.
2.2 Data Cleaning
First, I scraped the Wikipedia page for the neighborhoods, boroughs, and postal. Then,
scraped the Citypopulation page to obtain the populations from the different
boroughs.
Second, I had to clean the borough list from Wikipedia to match the borough list from
the Citypopulation page.
Third, I found the locations of the various neighborhoods of London and mapped them.
